 Democracy is everyday

All Days project intent to inspire digital democracy and technology adoption to build the future.
Democracy is not only about voting sometimes, democracy is everyday.
We are building a proof of concept taking Portugal elected political representatives as use case where we can vote one time by day.
Can be replicated in any country or different use case.

Project is based on Hyperledger Fabric, why:
Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger and Blockchain technology under Hyperledger Foundation https://www.hyperledger.org/ and Linux Foundation https://www.linuxfoundation.org/

All pieces to build digital democracy are now available, is up to us to put it in place.
Blockchain technology can keep votes integrity, no fake votes.
Decentralized systems bring scalability and put votes at edge, no central point to hack.
Hyperledger Fabric fit the requirements for a democratic use:
- Participants must be identified
- Networks need to be permissioned
- High transaction throughput performance
- Low latency of confirmation
- Privacy and confidentiality of votes
